# Portfolio Build & Testing Docker

A Docker environment for building and testing my portfolio website locally. The setup provides a consistent development environment using Jekyll and ensures the site works correctly before deployment.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build the Jekyll image
docker-compose build

# Run the development server
docker-compose up
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:4000`
